    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have reached a tipping point. THE tipping point that web evangelists have been predicting for years. As I write this blog the internet is teetering on a precipice!</p>

<p>Internet browsing – reading the news, shopping – is now more likely to be done on a mobile device or tablet, than from the desktop.</p>

<p>Why is this important to you? Well if you don’t have a website, it’s probably not, but if you do, it’s vital. Do you know how your site looks (or perhaps more importantly, performs) when viewed on an Android device, on a tablet or on an iPhone?</p>

<p>Did you consider mobile devices when your site was designed? Chances are, if your site is more than just a couple of years old, you didn’t. After all, the iPhone was only released as recently as 2007, although it feels like we’ve always had them.</p>

<p>If you’re asking yourself if you really need a site that works on a mobile phone, then that is a perfectly sensible and reasonable question to ask, but it’s not one you have to guess. Using analytics, as I talked about in a previous blog post, you can see exactly what visitors to your site were using. If only one percent of your visitors were on a mobile device, then perhaps you don’t need to worry about it. But, what if you discover that 60% of your visits came from a smartphone. And that your site really doesn’t work well on a smartphone. Well, then, perhaps a freshening up of the design might be in order.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, a developer might have made an assessment that most of the monitors out there have a resolution of 1024x768 so I will make a website to fit those dimensions. Chances were also that if a screen had a resolution of 1024x768 then it was of a similar physical size as well. Not anymore!</p>

<p>A screen of 1024 x 768 pixels could be anything from a large 32” television to a 6” smartphone screen. Would all your text and images be equally readable on both extremes? Would your site look horrible empty on the large screen but a squashed chaotic mess on the small?</p>

<p>You could build several different version of your site and have scripts running to detect the kind of device a visitor is using and serve them the appropriate version, but that’s a lot of work on those multiple sites and what if a new device comes out next year that doesn’t exist now? Need I mention the iPad?</p>

<p>The solution is to build one responsive website. Now your site will automatically adjust its layout and font sizes to suite the viewing screen and you never need to be concerned about needing to know what the device is.</p>

<p>The best scenario here is that you don’t have a website at all, and therefore responsiveness can just be designed in from the start. If your site is fairly modern and relatively simple then it could almost certainly be fashioned into a responsive site. If it is old, very complicated or was not written to modern correct W3C standards, then it might require more work.</p>

    <id>http://keav.net/octopress/blog/2014/09/17/why-you-should-love-analytics</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Analytics used to be the tool of only the largest companies with time and resources to dedicate staff to the task. It also required expensive software and dedicated servers and databases, to gather and log the information.</p>

<p>Now, all this power (information – knowledge is power, after all!) is accessible to anyone, and best of all, for free.</p>

<p>Analytics is, very simply put, is information about your website.  But that description really doesn’t do the subject justice. This information, interpreted correctly, can be used for so much more than just your website, it can apply to your whole business. It can be an insight into your customers, it can help identify unexpected markets, or help you improve your service to your existing customers.</p>

<p>Usage patterns of your visitors, not just how many visitors come to your site, but what they do while they’re there, what they used to visit your page (PC, mobile, tablet), what size screen they used. Where they were geographically in the world, Swansea or Hong Kong?!</p>

<p>Say you have two products on your site, one gets 1% views and the other 99%. At a minimum, this tells you one of two things. That there is a fault in the design of your website and it needs improving to make the first product more visible or, if we assume that both products are equally visible, perhaps you should reduce your stock orders of product A but increase your orders of product B tenfold! This is the kind of information that website analytics can provide - and it’s priceless.</p>

<p>The longer you monitor your site with analytics, the more complete the picture becomes.</p>

<p>You can monitor the site around the time of non-web based marketing promotions and analytics can also be embedded in marketing emails letting you know how successful any given mailshot was.</p>

<p>Once you have analytics running on your site and the information pouring in, you can begin to truly tailor your site for best impact. In my next two blogs, the first about Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) and the second about making your website work on mobile devices and tablets, I’ll explain how the information gathered from analytics can be applied to help you make the best choices.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Search Engine Optimization – SEO</p>

<p>Try Googling your website. Sounds like a simple enough thing to do, right?</p>

<p>But what are you actually going to type into Google to try to find your site? You know your business, and probably your website, intimately, so perhaps you know the terms to put in to get Google listing your site at the top of the page. If it doesn’t list at all, then you definitely have some work to do.</p>

<p>But what about some more obscure terms, or names of your products, type of product? Where does your site list now? First page? Second? Third?!</p>

<p>Search Engine Optimization is not as hard, or as technical, as it sounds. It is simply about knowing how a search site like Google lists and prioritizes sites, and then tailoring your own so that it lists as often as possible under the terms that you want. And equally as importantly, doesn’t list under search terms you don’t want to be associated with.</p>

<p>The modern day search engines are very good at what they do, and there is a chance that even knowing nothing about this subject and having never done anything specific with your site, it still lists prominently when the right terms are searched for. If that is the case, then great.</p>

<p>If not, there are many, comparatively simple things that can be done to ‘tailor’ how your site appears, and to ensure that it does appear, as often as possible and as high as possible. Fist result on the first page will do very nicely, thank you!</p>

    <link href="http://keav.net/octopress/blog/2014/09/16/why-w3c-standards-are-important/"/>
    <updated>2014-09-16T15:09:28+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://keav.net/octopress/blog/2014/09/16/why-w3c-standards-are-important</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The best way to ensure that a website works properly on all devices, operating systems and browsers is to code it following the recommended W3C standards.</p>

<p>The W3C is the group/body who oversee and rationalize the code that is used to write websites. Browser manufacturers then use this standard to write their browser (Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox etc.) software so that it knows how to correctly display a modern website. It is perfectly possible to write a website that barely follows that standards at all but still works on a particular system or browser but this will only be due to a very forgiving browser correcting the mistakes in the code on the fly and there is every chance that the site will eventually break when the browser is updated or will not work on other browsers or devices. Once upon a time 90% of internet users were on Windows and used Internet Explorer but this is far from the reality today and the number of devices and browsers in the world is only going to keep getting more diverse.</p>

<p>This is why browser manufacturers now all follow a centralized standard and it is important that these standards are also followed in creating your website.</p>
