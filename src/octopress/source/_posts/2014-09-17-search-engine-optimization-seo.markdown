Search Engine Optimization – SEO

Try Googling your website. Sounds like a simple enough thing to do, right?

But what are you actually going to type into Google to try to find your site? You know your business, and probably your website, intimately, so perhaps you know the terms to put in to get Google listing your site at the top of the page. If it doesn’t list at all, then you definitely have some work to do.

But what about some more obscure terms, or names of your products, type of product? Where does your site list now? First page? Second? Third?!

Search Engine Optimization is not as hard, or as technical, as it sounds. It is simply about knowing how a search site like Google lists and prioritizes sites, and then tailoring your own so that it lists as often as possible under the terms that you want. And equally as importantly, doesn’t list under search terms you don’t want to be associated with.

The modern day search engines are very good at what they do, and there is a chance that even knowing nothing about this subject and having never done anything specific with your site, it still lists prominently when the right terms are searched for. If that is the case, then great.

If not, there are many, comparatively simple things that can be done to ‘tailor’ how your site appears, and to ensure that it does appear, as often as possible and as high as possible. Fist result on the first page will do very nicely, thank you!
