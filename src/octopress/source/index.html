<p>This is my own personal blog but the subject matter here is mostly about Website Development - with the occasional spillage over into wider tech.</p>

<h2>What I'm up to this month...</h2>

<p>Currently I'm perfecting my <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> configuration and workflow.</p>
<p>Loving <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> 3 now that I have it configured properly.</p>
<p>Finding my way around <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. I will be attempting to build all my projects from now on with git and GitHub.</p>

<p>...and, of course, I'm experimenting with this new <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> blog!</p>
