<div class="entry-content"><p>We have reached a tipping point. THE tipping point that web evangelists have been predicting for years. As I write this blog the internet is teetering on a precipice!</p>

<p>Internet browsing – reading the news, shopping – is now more likely to be done on a mobile device or tablet, than from the desktop.</p>

<p>Why is this important to you? Well if you don’t have a website, it’s probably not, but if you do, it’s vital. Do you know how your site looks (or perhaps more importantly, performs) when viewed on an Android device, on a tablet or on an iPhone?</p>

<p>Did you consider mobile devices when your site was designed? Chances are, if your site is more than just a couple of years old, you didn’t. After all, the iPhone was only released as recently as 2007, although it feels like we’ve always had them.</p>

<p>If you’re asking yourself if you really need a site that works on a mobile phone, then that is a perfectly sensible and reasonable question to ask, but it’s not one you have to guess. Using analytics, as I talked about in a previous blog post, you can see exactly what visitors to your site were using. If only one percent of your visitors were on a mobile device, then perhaps you don’t need to worry about it. But, what if you discover that 60% of your visits came from a smartphone. And that your site really doesn’t work well on a smartphone. Well, then, perhaps a freshening up of the design might be in order.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, a developer might have made an assessment that most of the monitors out there have a resolution of 1024x768 so I will make a website to fit those dimensions. Chances were also that if a screen had a resolution of 1024x768 then it was of a similar physical size as well. Not anymore!</p>

<p>A screen of 1024 x 768 pixels could be anything from a large 32” television to a 6” smartphone screen. Would all your text and images be equally readable on both extremes? Would your site look horrible empty on the large screen but a squashed chaotic mess on the small?</p>

<p>You could build several different version of your site and have scripts running to detect the kind of device a visitor is using and serve them the appropriate version, but that’s a lot of work on those multiple sites and what if a new device comes out next year that doesn’t exist now? Need I mention the iPad?</p>

<p>The solution is to build one responsive website. Now your site will automatically adjust its layout and font sizes to suite the viewing screen and you never need to be concerned about needing to know what the device is.</p>

<p>The best scenario here is that you don’t have a website at all, and therefore responsiveness can just be designed in from the start. If your site is fairly modern and relatively simple then it could almost certainly be fashioned into a responsive site. If it is old, very complicated or was not written to modern correct W3C standards, then it might require more work.</p>
