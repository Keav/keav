This is my personal Website.

I use this as a personal development playground. It hosts a wordpress blog which may or may not be about motorbiking and an octopress blog which is more Website Development and tech oriented.

It also hosts my archived portfolio sites. If you wish to examine the (ancient) source code, have a browse in the portfolio folder.
